# fping

I worked with a couple of people running multiple ping processes in various
windows, to watch for systems to return after restarts. I told one of them
that fping would work better. I use fping from Linux all the time, but these
people did not have access to a Linux host. Rather than explain how to
install fping on their Mac and Windows laptops, I put together this simple
container.
